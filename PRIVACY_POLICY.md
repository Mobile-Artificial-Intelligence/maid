# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Mobile Artificial Intelligence app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Mobile Artificial Intelligence (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:

### Automatically Collected Information

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- App usage information, such as the pages/screens of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages/screens
- The time spent on the Application
- Device and app diagnostics information, such as:
  - Application version and build number (e.g., `appVersion`, `appBuild`)
  - Device model (e.g., `device`)
  - Operating system version and build identifiers (e.g., `osVersion`, `osBuildId`)
  - CPU / supported architectures (e.g., `cpu`)
  - Device memory size (e.g., `ram`)
  - Event timestamps related to actions in the app (e.g., `createTime`)
- AI configuration metadata, such as which AI provider type is selected and which model is used (e.g., `provider`, `model`), for reliability, debugging, and improving the Application

The Service Provider uses this information to operate, maintain, improve, and secure the Application, including diagnosing crashes or performance issues, and understanding overall usage patterns.

### User-Provided Information

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to **email**, **user_name**, and **user_id**. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained and used as described in this privacy policy.

Depending on how the Application is used, the Application may also process content you submit, such as messages, prompts, uploaded content, or other information you choose to provide when using the Application’s features (“User Content”). User Content is used to provide the Application’s functionality and to support troubleshooting and service improvement where applicable.

## Location Information

The Application does not gather precise location information (such as GPS-level location) unless you explicitly grant location permission and use a feature that requires it.

If you enable location-based features (if available), the Application may collect approximate location information (for example, derived from IP address or coarse device signals) to provide location-related functionality, analytics, and improvements. If the Application does not request location permission on your device, then it will not collect precise device location.

## How We Use Information

The Service Provider may use collected information to:

- Provide and maintain the Application and its features
- Improve performance, reliability, and user experience
- Debug issues, prevent fraud/abuse, and enhance security
- Communicate important notices related to the Application (and, where permitted, marketing promotions)

## Third Party Access

The Service Provider may share information with third parties only as described in this privacy statement, including:

- Service providers that help operate the Application (for example: hosting, databases, authentication, storage, crash reporting, analytics, or customer support). These providers process information on the Service Provider’s behalf and are not permitted to use it for their own independent purposes.
- AI service providers or model runtimes (depending on how the Application is configured) to process requests and generate responses. The specific information shared depends on the feature you use and what you submit.
- Legal and safety reasons, including:
  - as required by law (e.g., subpoena or similar legal process);
  - when disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests.

The Service Provider may share aggregated and/or anonymized information (which does not reasonably identify you) to help improve the Application; however, some features may require sharing certain data with service providers as described above (for example, to process AI requests or store your account data).

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data (including account information and, where applicable, User Content) for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. The Service Provider will also retain certain automatically collected information (such as diagnostic and security logs) for as long as necessary to:

- maintain the Application,
- comply with legal obligations,
- resolve disputes, and
- enforce agreements.

If you'd like the Service Provider to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at **dane_madsen@hotmail.com** and they will respond in a reasonable time.

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.

If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (dane_madsen@hotmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of **2026-02-14**. *(Update this date to your actual release/update date.)*

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
