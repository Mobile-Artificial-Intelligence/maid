The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of in below ways:

*   Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to email, user_name, user_id.
